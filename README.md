## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Description
```
The goal of the site is to RANDOMLY generate a password between 8 and 128 characters using at least one character types from Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and special Characters.  A prompt will ask which ones you would like your password to include and if you chose at least one character type it will generate a random password from them.  If not it will prompt you to choose atleast one type.  Once the criteria is filled it will vomit up a password of your chosen length randomly chosen from the types you choose.
```
